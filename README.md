## About
This is a React web application that displays real-time and historical data, including trending news stories, for a number of popular cryptocurrencies. We also incorporated some predictive graphs which render potential trends of the most popular coins using a built-in algorithm.

### Project Details
This application was developed by three young [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com) developers. We used [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and multiple associated [npm packages](http://npmjs.com) as the framework for the application, with a healthy dose of [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/) to smooth out the edges. The data being displayed is rendered using two APIs provided courtesy of [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/), a well-renowed authority employed by the likes of Coinbase and Samsung, and [CryptoControl](https://cryptocontrol.io/en/developers/apis), the leading aggregate source of news from the crypto space. 

We primarily used [npm](http://npmjs.com), [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com), and the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com) to render and debug the code. This was first endeavor together as a team, and we appreciated the opportunity to sharpen our skills and achieve new heights thanks to the flexibility of React. The application was deployed live on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and will be maintained and updated as needed to provide an engaging experience to our users.
