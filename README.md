### Project Details
This project is being developed by a three-man team with help from the Ironhack instructors. We are using React.js and its associated npm packages as the framework for the application, with a healthy dose of Bulma CSS to smooth out the edges. The data being displayed is rendered using an API provided courtesy of CoinMarketCap, a well-renowed authority employed by the likes of Coinbase and Samsung.

We are primarily using npm, Microsoft Visual Studio, and the Google Developer Console to render and debug the code. This is our largest endeavor thus far, and we are excited for the opportunity to sharpen our skills and achieve new heights thanks to the flexibility of React. The application will ultimately be deployed using GitHub pages.
